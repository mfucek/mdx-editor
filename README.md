# MDX-EDITOR

This repository currently contains an example project using the mdx-editor hook.

Todo list:

[ ] Add undo functionality
[ ] Predefined component detection in EditorLine.tsx (encoding / decoding from mdx string)
[ ] Fix scrolling on rerender when content is higher than the height of the page
